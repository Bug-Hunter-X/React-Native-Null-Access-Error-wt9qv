This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object before it has been fully initialized or when the object is null or undefined. This is common in asynchronous operations where data fetching or state updates happen after the component renders.  For example, if you try to render a list of items from a state variable before the data has been fetched, you'll likely encounter this error.
